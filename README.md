# monkeytype-themes

Welcome to monkeytype-themes, a repository containing all the custom  themes I have created for [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com).

## How to install themes

1. Install the Stylus browser extension: [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)

2. Open any css file in this repository and click the "Raw" button at the top of the file OR click an install link in the themes section below.

3. The stylus extension should open up with a button to install the style.

4. Make sure to check the "Check for updates" box to get automatic updates if I update the theme in the future.

## Themes

Most themes only change some parts of monkeytype and can be used together.

### Base

[Install link](https://github.com/refact0r/monkeytype-themes/raw/main/base.user.css)

Basic tweaks like hiding the unnecessary bottom buttons, centering the top menu, and changing logo text.

### Icons

[Install link](https://github.com/refact0r/monkeytype-themes/raw/main/icons.user.css)

Replaces the default Font Awesome icons with Bootstrap icons (which look better). Also adds a few animations to the menu buttons and the buttons that show after completing a test.
