# monkeytype-themes

Welcome to monkeytype-themes, a repository containing all the custom  themes I have created for [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com).

## how to install themes

1. Install the Stylus browser extension: [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)
2. Open any css file in this repository that ends with `.user.css`
3. Click the "Raw" button at the top of the file.
4. The stylus extension should open up with a button to install the style.
5. Make sure to check the "Check for updates" box to get automatic updates if I update the theme in the future.

## themes

### icons

Replaces the default Font Awesome icons in monkeytype with Bootstrap icons (which look better). Also adds a few animations to the menu buttons and the buttons that show after completing a test.
