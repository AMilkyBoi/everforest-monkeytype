# monkeytype-themes

Welcome to monkeytype-themes, a repository containing custom  themes I have created for [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com).

## How to install themes

1. Install the Stylus browser extension: [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)

2. Click an install link in the themes section below OR open any css file in this repository and click the "Raw" button at the top of the file.

3. The stylus extension should open up with a button to install the style.

## Component Themes

These are themes only change one specific part of Monkeytype and can be used together with other themes.

### Base

[Install link](https://github.com/refact0r/monkeytype-themes/raw/main/base.user.css)

Basic tweaks like hiding the unnecessary bottom buttons, centering the top menu, and changing logo text.

### Icons

[Install link](https://github.com/refact0r/monkeytype-themes/raw/main/icons.user.css)

Replaces the default Font Awesome icons with Bootstrap icons (which look better). Also adds a few animations to the menu buttons and the buttons that show after completing a test.

### Clean command line

[Install link](https://github.com/refact0r/monkeytype-themes/raw/main/cleancommandline.user.css)

Removes command line box background and adds a blur behind it for a cleaner look. Works best if you already have a background image.


## Style Themes

These are themes that change the color and feel of Monkeytype. Don't mix style themes, but feel free to use them with component themes.

### Iceland

[Install link](https://github.com/refact0r/monkeytype-themes/raw/main/iceland.user.css)
