<h1>everforest-monkeytype</h1>

A fork of refact0r's [monkeytype themes](https://github.com/refact0r/monkeytype-themes) made specifically to support sainnhe's [everforest theme](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest) for [vim](https://github.com/vim/vim). The base theme has also been changed to only center the top menu.

## How to install themes

1. Install the Stylus browser extension: [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)

2. Click a theme install link below OR open any css file in this repository and click the "Raw" button at the top of the file.

3. The stylus extension should open up with a button to install the style.

NOTE FOR FIREFOX USERS: You need to enable backdrop-filter in the firefox config for background blur to work. Tutorial [here](https://dev.to/snkds/how-to-enable-backdrop-filter-in-firefox-2n8e).

## Component Themes

These are themes that change small parts of monkeytype and can be used together.

### Base  
[Install](https://github.com/refact0r/monkeytype-themes/raw/main/base.user.css)

Basic tweaks like hiding the unnecessary bottom buttons, centering the top menu, and changing logo text.

### Icons  
[Install](https://github.com/refact0r/monkeytype-themes/raw/main/icons.user.css)

Replaces the default Font Awesome icons with Bootstrap icons (which look better). Also adds a few animations to the menu buttons and the buttons that show after completing a test.

### Clean command line
[Install](https://github.com/refact0r/monkeytype-themes/raw/main/cleancommandline.user.css)

Removes command line box background and adds a blur behind it for a cleaner look. Works best if you already have a background image.
